# Audio-Feedback-System

In today's pandemic situation, electronic education is an important part of the academic domain. Faced with the strong growth of popularity of online education, a need arises for a flexible, strengthened & easily integrated online academic feedback delivery system. The ‘Audio Feedback System’ approach is all about institutional and educational practices and processes that are taken into consideration, the student’s concerns of the level of the knowledge they receive. This procedure explains that there is a good relationship between the students and their learning environment. We have developed an Audio Feedback System to provide feedback in an easy and consistent manner to the academic institution. We call this an Audio Feedback System as students can voice out the reviews instead of typing them or answering questions, which will greatly reduce the time and improve efficiency in the feedback delivery mechanism.
